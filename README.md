Job Description for Entry-Level Full Stack Developer

Status: We’re still hiring for both roles! (last updated June 5, 2018)

Location
Santa Clara, CA (near Central Expressway and Oakmead Parkway); the positions are onsite (not remote).

Compensation
$3,000 or $4,000 per month for full-time work (40 hours/week), depending on the role selected (the non-healthcare specific role pays $3,000 and the healthcare-specific one pays $4,000). In both roles, the company offers a $350 pre-tax stipend that can be used for benefits (such as health insurance). The compensation is not open to negotiation.

Timeframe: The positions are available immediately.

Technology stack: The healthcare-specific role uses Java/JSP/Spring/MySQL on Ubuntu and the other role uses React/Java/PostgreSQL.

Role
For the healthcare-specific role, the successful candidate will:
help revamp and extend our website
build various internal tools
overhaul our CSS architecture

The non-healthcare specific role involves building front-end user interfaces for various infrastructure tools that are not related to healthcare. The work will involve much React, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java. No experience or prior knowledge of React is necessary.

If you’re only interested in a time-limited internship, please e-mail us below for additional details.

Company
At DocSpot, we’re trying to help people make better healthcare decisions. Our main service helps patients find doctors based on criteria that are important to them. Check out https://www.docspot.com to explore our doctor search engine for yourself.
DocSpot.com was first launched in 2010, and our web traffic has grown significantly since then.
We have also achieved several meaningful revenue milestones, including a contract with one of the largest insurance companies in the US and a partnership with a major media outlet.
Requirements
Legal right to work within the US
Some working knowledge of programming (including a server-side language)

Prior professional experience and related degrees (e.g. computer science) are not required.
We are willing to train the right candidate. Knowledge of Java, SQL, and Linux would be helpful, although not strictly necessary.
If you interview with us, we will likely ask you to demonstrate proficiency with regards to these programming concepts: for-loops, pass-by-reference, hash tables, recursive functions. Please note that you will be expected to be proficient in these concepts and to be able to code solutions to simple problems without needing a computer. These are all things that you can research before an interview and learn reasonably quickly.
A note to foreign applicants: we’re a small company and at this time, we do not intend to sponsor anyone for this role. We welcome candidates who can work as part of their OPT, but will not need sponsorship.

Desired Qualities

Integrity - First and foremost, the successful candidate needs to be absolutely trustworthy in handling the proprietary processes of the company, and in following through on commitments.

Ability to learn quickly and respond to feedback -  We don’t pretend to have all of the answers to the problems that we are working on, but we do expect people to be able to figure out reasonable and practical solutions as we go along. As part of this team of learners, the successful candidate will also need to research and understand what’s needed in order to get the job done.

Self-starter attitude - The role will involve many independent projects in the context of a small and close-knit team. The ideal candidate would be strong both in individual work ethic and in ability to work and communicate well with co-workers.

Attention to detail and capacity to focus on the big picture - Some people love to dream grand visions and leave implementation to someone else; others can work systematically through a list of tasks, but have a harder time articulating how the process can be improved. We’re looking for a mix, with an emphasis on being detail-oriented. Some parts of the role might at times seem tedious, and we’ll need people to stick through the work. At the same time, if there’s a better way of doing things, we want to hear about it.

Ability to offer user-interface suggestions and a willingness to iterate - Our UI design process generally involves many iterations (most of them via prototypes).

Interest in healthcare - Not required, but is a plus for the healthcare-specific role.

#To apply: Send your answers to the following questions and a copy of your resume to jobs@docspot.com. You should expect a response to your application if you answer every question. If you have answered every question but do not receive a reply within a week, please write to us again (it’s probable in that case that we didn’t receive your application). Please take your time to think through your answers, researching answers for the technical ones if needed.

What characterizes your ideal job? (Your ideal job doesn't have to match this one.)


What companies or organizations do you admire and why? Please pick one or two specific organizations that are meaningful to you. We encourage you to stay away from safe answers such as Google and Apple, unless you have a truly compelling reason that distinguishes your admiration from that of many others.


How did you find out about this posting? (e.g. Craigslist, Handshake)


a. Which websites have a good user interface to allow people to browse and buy things online, and what do you like about those interfaces? Additionally, what do you think they could do better? If you don’t like any, please critique one of the major shopping websites and share why you don’t like it. Note that many people have already answered Amazon.com.

b. Which websites do you feel exemplify good design? The site you choose does not need to be as complex as a major shopping site. Please explain why you think that the website was successful in balancing form and function.


###Please create a web page that has a 4x4 grid, with a border around it. The grid should be horizontally centered in the web page. Every 250 milliseconds, one of the eligible squares should be randomly selected to change colors. Squares are eligible for a color change if its color has not changed in the last two seconds.

Feel free to conduct research on the web, but do not ask anyone for help. Also, do not use any libraries (e.g. jQuery) or any publishing software such as Microsoft Word. If you’re unable to create this page (even after consulting the web), this role probably won’t be a good fit. We encourage you to spend some time to verify the logic in your solution.

Please send a copy of (or a link to) a project that you've worked on that you're proud of, whether that be a paper you wrote, a YouTube video that you put together, or a picture of some handiwork you did. If it's not practical to send a copy of the project, please describe what you did. In either case, please include a short blurb as to why you're proud of that piece of work or why it was meaningful to you. Do not feel compelled to submit a programming-related project. Instead, make sure you describe a project that you have spent a substantial amount of time on (over one month) and that you feel proud of. We have found that school-assigned programming projects tend to not make for great submissions.

If you are going to point us to some code, please send us a link to where we can see the code in action. That is, please do not just send a GitHub repository -- we might be interested in seeing your code, but only after we can see it in action.
